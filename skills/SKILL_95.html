This meeting was broken up into four basic parts

<ol>
<li>Review of minutes of previous meeting

This was a lengthy process - it turned out we could not agree on a process for reviewing the minutes. 
The following is a list of points discussed during the minutes review.

<Menu>
<li> 
  a) Reading the minutes and asking for consent bogged down.
<li> 
  b) Several clarifications were made on perspectives of how the minutes read about the ground rules 
affinitizing 
<li> 
  c) Facilitator continued to demand no one speak while the person who has the floor (Paul) is speaking 
and allowed to finish his point.
<li> 
  d) Hien asked what was behind Paul's statement "If we could identify his improvement suggestions 
from the minutes - I would be amazed". Paul's point being that the minutes of previous meeting 
reflected what happened!
<li> 
  e) Tom blocked on how progress was being made on the minutes and Paul handed Tom the facilitator 
role for a short period.
<li> 
  f) Tom was assigned the action of establishing a process for reviewing the meeting minutes.
</Menu>

<li>A session on balancing advocacy with inquiry using the ground rules:

Tom proposed a clarification question on the ground rules of advocacy and having the "floor". Used 
the question: how to allow clarification in the middle of a presentation without blocking?

Advocacy Questions:

  - are you sure?

  - Surfacing new/alternative course of actions

Inquiry Questions:

  - What are your assumptions?

  - Data: every time we interrupt, accused of blocking - this can be bad

Clarification questions:

  - How do you do this?

  - What do you mean?

  - Are these understanding (inquiry) questions or blocking (advocacy) questions?

Question: How do I know "when" to give input (to participate in the process) and not be blocking? or 
give too much information which leads to blocking?

Paul advocating a key issue:

  - Understand the process.

  - know the desired outcome, the objective, the aim

  - What are the next steps in the process?

  - Help make these steps (actions) happen.

Tom advocating:

  - Knowledge verses learning = advocacy/inquiry balancing

  - Knowledge comes from the outside

  - Learning is sharing pool of experiences/understanding/learnings

<li>Creating a simple causal loop on how does one pick a residence

The process followed was a) Phrase question on residences, b) use the Creative Systemic Quality 
Deployment (CSQD) process to brainstorm needs, actions, sabotaging actions and counter measures, 
c) build the loop/system. The ** denote the path taken.

Needs:

- cost effective

- privacy/enough space

- **location**

Reinforcing actions:

- **find a job** - strong

- locate school - medium

- find public transportation - low

- determine commute time - medium

Balancing/Sabotaging actions:

- vacation

- spend time with family

- turn down job offer

- **skiing**

This lead to the following diagram:

Key:

o - opposing

s - supporting

A - Action

B - Balancing

CA - Countermeasure Action

LC - Limiting Condition

N - Need

R - Reinforcing

SA - Sabotaging Action

<li>A wrap up which include exchange of the following information:

  a) Exchange of information on the kinds of reinforcing loops as described by Dr. Munn.

  b) Review of progress to this point - why so slow. Move faster by getting more work done outside of 
meetings. More work on what? More prep work on team process.

  c) quick review of the causal diagram of the god's eye view. Using the ideas originally brainstormed 
as objects, a causal diagram can quickly be generated.

<li>Deltas:	Author

1) written process for reviewing meetings minutes and deltas	Hien

2) Keep emotions in check (Proactive "Management of awareness" technique)	Hien

3) Don't raise voice	Hien

4) Take time out (op for walk)	Hien

5) Let facilitator do job - i.e. facilitate the meeting process	Paul

6) Understand cost when we block - other members should point out blocking	Paul

7) Schedule session to discuss/define "blocking"	Paul

8) Learn different techniques to get people to respond w/o challenging them	Tom

<li>Next meeting agenda and roles

- Next meeting on Thursday, 21st December 1995 at 9:00 - Tom to facilitate

- Hien to present  the review of the team progress to date. Everyone to have read her previous 
handout.

- Paul to lead a team round robin through the following process

  1. Review draft ground rules

  2. Ask for change or questions

  3. Ask for consensus on changes, recording the Q/A to help define ground rules.

<li>Page of Guidelines for reviewing meeting minutes

· Determine if everyone has read the minutes from the previous meeting - if not, determine if they 
would like to take the meeting time to read them now.

· Does anyone have any corrections or clarifications of the meeting minutes?

· Now a review of the key points of the previous meeting as bolded in the meeting minutes. Team to 
decide the definition of key points.

- This format gives no analysis of what happened the previous meeting.
