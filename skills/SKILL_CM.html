<h1>Contact Management for beginners<br>
</h1>
<hr>
<h2>What is Contact Management (CM) or Personal Information Manager
(PIM)<br>
</h2>
We all make contacts as we live our lives; relatives, friends,
neighbors, work associates, customers.<br>
<br>
Let's define contact information as a piece of information that
uniquely identifies that person for you but the identification method
is owned by someone else, a third party.<br>
<br>
The original contact method was by US land mail address.<br>
<br>
100 years ago telephone number contact was added.<br>
<br>
In the last 20 years, email, cell phone, instant messaging, public key
encryption and more have been added as technology has changed.<br>
<br>
Personal Information Manager adds other information about the person to
the contact information - like maybe a spouse name, a child's name, a
position in a company.<br>
<ul>
  <li>personal notes <br>
  </li>
  <li>task lists <br>
  </li>
  <li>calendar dates (birthday, anniversaries, appointments) <br>
  </li>
  <li>voicemail <br>
  </li>
  <li>project manangement</li>
</ul>
Today we will focus on the CM portion only, mainly:<br>
<ul>
  <li>US mail (home, buisness, other)</li>
  <li>phone numbers: land (house, buisness), cell, fax, secondary <br>
  </li>
  <li>email (personal, buisness) <br>
  </li>
  <li>instant message agents (aol, yahoo, msn)</li>
  <li>public key encryption</li>
</ul>
<h2>Taxonomy of CM methods</h2>
Everyone does CM by some method. We starts simple:<br>
<br>
A piece of paper, a scratch by the wall phone.<br>
<br>
An address book from office depot (often large first, small second).<br>
<br>
We graduate to cell phones and company business databases and PDAs.<br>
<br>
Business card scanners and ACT commercial software are the top of the
line products today.<br>
<br>
Outlook, the swiss army knife of Microsoft products is also commonly
used.<br>
<br>
<h2>Assets/liability questions:</h2>
<br>
What assets to consider when looking for your contact management choice:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Is there a way to obsolete information?</li>
  <li>Are there ways to age information (keep old job and new job)<br>
  </li>
  <li>Can contacts be categorized?</li>
  <li>What synchronization methods are offered? <br>
  </li>
</ol>
What liabilities should you look out for?<br>
<ol>
  <li>Is there a way to back up and restore contacts?</li>
  <li>Is it free or commercial?</li>
  <li>Is it compatible with your current contact system?<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<br>
<h2>Wrap up</h2>
<br>
Plan for obsolesense.<br>
<br>
Tying it all together, cell phone, outlook, yahoo and plaxo<br>
<ul>
</ul>
